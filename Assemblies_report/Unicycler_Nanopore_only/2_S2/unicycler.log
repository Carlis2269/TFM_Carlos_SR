Starting Unicycler (2025-03-27 15:38:18)
----------------------------------------
    Welcome to Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes. Since you provided only long reads, Unicycler will assemble the reads with miniasm and then run repeated polishing rounds using Racon.
    For more information, please see https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler

Polishing miniasm assembly with Racon (2025-03-27 15:42:31)
-----------------------------------------------------------
    Unicycler now uses Racon to polish the miniasm assembly. It does multiple rounds of polishing to get the best consensus. Circular unitigs are rotated between rounds such that all parts (including the ends) are polished well.

Rotating completed replicons (2025-03-27 15:45:11)
--------------------------------------------------
    Any completed circular contigs (i.e. single contigs which have one link connecting end to start) can have their start position changed without altering the sequence. For consistency, Unicycler now searches for a starting gene (dnaA or repA) in each such contig, and if one is found, the contig is rotated to start with that gene on the forward strand.
