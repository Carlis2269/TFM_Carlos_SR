Removing output files of failed job unicycler_assemblies since they might be corrupted:
/mnt/d/Documentos/Sequences/Hybrid/unicycler_assemblies
Skipped removing non-empty directory /mnt/d/Documentos/Sequences/Hybrid/unicycler_assemblies
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
